<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![Final Scene](final.png)  

The aim of the project is to simulate a robotic arm which picks up white and black boxes from a conveyor and places them on separate conveyors. This is accomplished with the use of inverse kinematics and path planning. In this project, we have used a KUKA robot which is already inbuilt in CoppeliaSim/V-REP software.   
Refer this [documentation](report.pdf).

### Tech Stack
Software used for this project :  
   [V-REP/CoppeliaSim (specifically, V-REP PRO EDU 3.6.2 version has been used)](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)

### File Structure

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 CoppeliaSim/V-REP

  You can visit the [Coppelia Robotics website](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/previousVersions) for the installation. We have used V-REP PRO EDU Version 3.6.2 for our project.
  

### Installation
Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tejal-19/simbotix.git
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
```
Open PickAndPlace.ttt in V-REP and start the simulation.
```


<!-- RESULTS AND DEMO -->

<!-- FUTURE WORK -->
## Future Work
* Extracting coordinates of white boxes
- [x] Add Vision Sensor
- [x] Add Blob Detection Filter
- [x] Add Vision Sensor script
- [x] Convert all coordinates to metres  
* Other possible modifications:
- [ ] Adding camera/vision sensors to detect object
- [ ] Changing the robot and gripper, or designing one
- [ ] Make the robot mobile
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance and end-to-end planning

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting
* The robotic arm moves erratically  
  Change position of target dummy. If that doesn't work, adjust the pos angles.
* The arm does not follow the path  
  Make sure all the joints are set to Inverse Kinematics mode. Also check the code to see whether path is created correctly.
* Gripper does not work  
  Disable or delete the default script of the gripper and replace it with the one used in PickAndPlace.ttt.
